# Predictably Noisy on Sphinx!

This is an experiment in hosting my personal website and blog via Sphinx extensions instead of using Jekyll. It uses the [pydata sphinx theme](https://pydata-sphinx-theme.readthedocs.io/) along with [ablog](https://ablog.readthedocs.io/) for blogging, and the [myst-parser](https://myst-parser.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) and [myst-nb](https://myst-nb.readthedocs.io/) packages for writing posts in Markdown and Jupyter Notebooks.

See the [](blog) for the latest posts!
