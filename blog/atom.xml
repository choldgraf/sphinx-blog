    <title>Three things I love about CircleCI</title>
    <updated>2019-01-29T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I recently had to beef up the continuous deployment of Jupyter Book, and used
it as an opportunity to learn a bit more about CircleCI’s features. It turns out,
they’re pretty cool! Here are a few of the things that I learned this time around.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Thoughts from the Jupyter team meeting 2019</title>
    <updated>2019-03-30T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I just got back from a week-long Jupyter team meeting that was somehow both
very tiring and energizing at the same time. In the spirit of openness, I’d
like to share some of my experience. While it’s still fresh in my mind,
here are a few takeaways that occurred to me throughout the week.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>A few recent talks</title>
    <updated>2019-06-25T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Lately I’ve given quite a number of talks about the Jupyter and Binder
ecosystems for various purposes. Before each of the talks, I make the
slides available at a public address in case others are interested in
following up with the material. For those who missed the talks (or the
subsequent tweets about them), here are a few of the more recent ones.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Automating Jupyter Book deployments with CI/CD</title>
    <updated>2019-10-11T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Lately I’ve spent a lot of time trying to reduce the friction involved
in deploying Jupyter Book as well as contributing to the project.
Features are a great carrot, but ultimately getting engagement is also
about lowering barriers to entry and showing people a path forward.
Jupyter Book is a relatively straightforward project, but it involves
a few technical pieces that can be painful to use (thanks Jekyll).&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>What would Rust-style governance look like in Jupyter?</title>
    <updated>2019-10-13T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;As I’ve written about before, I &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://predictablynoisy.com/rust-governance"&gt;like Rust’s governance structure&lt;/a&gt;.
I mean, who can’t get behind a community that
&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.rust-lang.org/governance"&gt;lists governance as a top-level page on its website&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Analyzing intracranial electrophysiology data with xarray</title>
    <updated>2019-10-22T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Over the last few years, it has been exciting to see the xarray project evolve,
add new functionality, and mature. This post is an attempt at
giving xarray another visit to see how it could integrate into electrophysiology
workflows.&lt;/p&gt;

directly port the governance model of other communities into the Jupyter project.

    <title>What do people think about rST?</title>
    <updated>2020-01-22T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Publishing computational narratives has always been a dream of the Jupyter Project,
and there is still a lot of work to be done in improving these use-cases. We’ve made
a lot of progress in providing open infrastructure for reproducible science with
&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://jupyterhub.readthedocs.io/en/stable/"&gt;JupyterHub&lt;/a&gt; and
&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://mybinder.org/"&gt;the Binder Project&lt;/a&gt;, but what about the documents themselves?
We’ve recently been working on tools like &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://jupyterbook.org"&gt;Jupyter Book&lt;/a&gt;,
which aim to improve the writing and publishing process with the Jupyter ecosystem.
This is hopefully the first post of a few that ask how we can best-improve the state
of publishing with Jupyter.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>A few tips for working remotely</title>
    <updated>2020-05-04T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Now that many have shifted to some form of remote work, I’ve had quite a few
conversations where others were asking for best-practices or tips in working in
distributed and remote teams/communities. Most of my work over the past few years has been
remote in some form or another, so here are a few things I’ve learned in the process.&lt;/p&gt;
